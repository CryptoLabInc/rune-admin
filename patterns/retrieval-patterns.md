# Context Retrieval Patterns

This document contains comprehensive question patterns that indicate when users are searching for past organizational context. These patterns are organized by intent and domain.

**Usage**: Claude uses these patterns to recognize when to search organizational memory and retrieve relevant historical context.

## Query Patterns by Intent

### Understanding Past Decisions
- "Why did we..."
- "What was the reasoning..."
- "What led to..."
- "How did we arrive at..."

### Seeking Context
- "What was happening when..."
- "What were the circumstances..."
- "What constraints existed..."
- "What was the background..."

### Looking for Precedent
- "Have we done this before?"
- "Is there a pattern for..."
- "What's our standard approach..."
- "How have we handled similar..."

### Checking Status
- "What's the current state of..."
- "Where are we with..."
- "What happened to..."
- "Did we ever..."

### Linguistic Universals (Generalized Patterns)
**Information Seeking Speech Acts**:
- **Canonical Status**: "What is the canonical way to...", "Is there a standard for..."
- **Origin/Provenance**: "What is the genesis of...", "Derivation of..."
- **Teleological (Purpose matches)**: "For what purpose was X created?", "To what end..."
- **Consensus Verification**: "Do we have consensus on...", "Is it agreed that..."
- **Counterfactuals**: "What if we had chosen...", "Would X have worked if..."

### Finding Ownership
- "Who decided..."
- "Which team owns..."
- "Who's responsible for..."
- "Whose decision was..."

---

## Natural Language Variations

### Conversational Forms
- "I'm wondering why we chose X?"
- "Can you remind me what we decided about Y?"
- "Do we have a standard for Z?"
- "Wasn't there a decision about this?"

### Implicit Queries
- "Tell me about [topic]"
- "What's our approach to [challenge]?"
- "How do we handle [situation]?"
- "What do we know about [subject]?"

---

## Query Optimization Strategies

### Specific vs. Broad
**Specific** (Preferred):
- "Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MySQL for the user service?"
- "What were the performance requirements for the API gateway?"

**Too Broad** (Needs refinement):
- "Why database?"
- "Tell me about architecture"

### Time-Scoped Queries
- "What did we decide last quarter?"
- "What were recent discussions about X?"
- "What changed since [date/event]?"

### Domain-Scoped Queries
- "What technical decisions..."
- "What security policies..."
- "What customer feedback on..."

## Implementation Notes

**For Claude**: When you detect these retrieval patterns:

1. **Parse Intent**: Understand what type of context is being requested
2. **Scope Search**: Determine relevant domains, timeframes, and people
3. **Execute Query**: Search FHE-encrypted organizational memory
4. **Rank Results**: Prioritize by relevance and recency
5. **Present Context**: Include sources, timestamps, and attributions

**Search Strategies**:
- Semantic similarity for concept matching
- Exact phrase matching for specific terms
- Temporal filtering for time-scoped queries
- Domain tagging for scoped searches

**Result Presentation**:
- Always include source (who/when)
- Provide relevant excerpts, not full dumps
- Offer to elaborate if user needs more detail
- Link related decisions when relevant
