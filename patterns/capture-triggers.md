- Lessons from failures
- Team agreements and policies

- Technical patterns and standards
- Customer feedback and insights
- Performance optimizations
- Design rationale
- Process documentation

### Context-Dependent Triggers
- Consider conversation depth

## Implementation Notes

**For Claude**: When you detect these trigger phrases:

1. **Assess Significance**: Is this a meaningful decision or insight?
2. **Capture Context**: Include surrounding rationale and constraints
3. **Add Metadata**: Tag with domain, role, and timestamp
4. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure "why" is captured, not just "what"

**Significance Threshold**: 0.7 (configurable in settings)

**Automatic Redaction**: Always redact:
- API keys, tokens, passwords
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Sensitive customer data
- Credentials and secrets
