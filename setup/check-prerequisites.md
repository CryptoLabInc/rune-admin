# Rune - Prerequisites Check

Welcome! Before using Rune, please ensure you have the following credentials from your team.

## Required: Rune-Vault Access

Your team administrator should have provided you with:

### 1. Vault URL
**Format**: `https://vault-YOURTEAM.oci.envector.io`

**Example**: `https://vault-acme.oci.envector.io`

This is your team's shared encryption key vault. All team members connect to the same Vault to share organizational memory.

### 2. Vault Token
**Format**: `evt_YOURTEAM_xxx`

**Example**: `evt_acme_abc123def456`

This authenticates you to access your team's Vault. Keep this secure and never share it outside your team.

---

## Required: enVector Cloud Credentials

Your team administrator or you personally should have signed up at [https://envector.io](https://envector.io) and obtained:

### 3. Cluster Endpoint
**Format**: `https://cluster-xxx.envector.io`

**Example**: `https://cluster-us-west-2.envector.io`

This is your encrypted vector database endpoint. All data stored here is FHE-encrypted.

### 4. API Key
**Format**: `envector_xxx`

**Example**: `envector_abc123def456`

This authenticates your requests to the enVector Cloud API.

## Prerequisites Check

Do you have all four pieces of information ready?

### ✅ Yes, I have everything
Great! Run `/rune configure` to set up your credentials and activate the plugin.

### ⏸️ No, I'm missing some information

#### Missing Vault credentials?
**Contact your team administrator** who deployed the Rune-Vault infrastructure. They should provide:
- Vault URL
- Vault Token

If your team hasn't deployed Rune-Vault yet, see the [full Rune deployment guide](https://github.com/CryptoLabInc/rune-admin).

#### Missing enVector credentials?
**Sign up at [https://envector.io](https://envector.io)**:
1. Create an account
2. Create a cluster (or use existing)
3. Generate an API key
4. Note your cluster endpoint

Alternatively, ask your team administrator if they have already set up a shared enVector Cloud account.

## What happens after configuration?

Once configured with `/rune configure`:

### Active State ✅
- **Automatic context capture**: Claude will automatically identify and store significant organizational decisions
- **Context retrieval**: Ask Claude about past decisions and get full context
- **Team sharing**: All team members with the same Vault see the same organizational memory
- **Zero-knowledge security**: enVector Cloud never sees plaintext data

### Example Usage

**Automatic capture**:
```
You: "We decided to use PostgreSQL because it has better JSON support than MySQL"
Claude: [Automatically stores this decision in organizational memory]
```

**Manual storage**:
```
You: /rune remember "All API endpoints must use JWT authentication"
Claude: ✓ Stored in organizational memory
```

**Retrieval**:
```
You: "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?"
Claude: According to organizational memory from 2 weeks ago:
"We decided to use PostgreSQL because it has better JSON support than MySQL"
```

## Security & Privacy

### What gets encrypted?
- All conversational context
- All organizational decisions
- All code patterns and rationale

### What can the cloud provider see?
- **Nothing**: All data is FHE-encrypted before leaving your machine
- Cloud only sees encrypted vectors (mathematical noise)
- Only your team's Vault can decrypt

### Who has access?
- **Team members**: Anyone with your Vault URL + Token
- **Cloud provider**: No access (zero-knowledge encryption)
- **Admin control**: Revoke access by rotating Vault tokens
